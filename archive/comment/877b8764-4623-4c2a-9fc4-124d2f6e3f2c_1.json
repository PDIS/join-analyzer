But to be entirely honest I'm not very hopeful that anything meaningful will change anytime soon. Which saddens me, I've lived and worked here most of my adult life, Taiwan is very much my home. But the reality is that as a &quot;foreigner&quot; I'm denied many benefits and rights that are afforded to my Taiwanese counterparts. Renouncing my home country's citizenship is not an option for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>One of the main things that could and should be changed is having to renounce citizenship to gain Taiwanese citizenship. And the benefits that are afforded to dependents and family members of residents. If I was able to have citizenship my spouse would be permitted to live and work here legally. Denying residents, and permanent resident dependents work permits makes no sense is one of the many reasons foreigners and foreign talent don't want to come here or stay here. There are many articles and websites that offer advice about where to live and work overseas and it's agreed that if you're young and don't intend to stay too long, Taiwan is amazing. But if you're looking to settle down, make a home of it, you have a family or wish to have a family.... this is not the place for you. You will always be a guest, never fully welcome. <br/>15 years, and it's a sad realization that if changes are not made and soon I might have to leave my home and move on. It's pretty depressing and I try not to think about it too much. I've wanted Taiwanese Citizenship for more than 8 years, if you change the rules I will be one of the first people in line.","displayStyle":"normal","status":"ENABLE","isAnonymous":"Y","hasMoreReply":false,"canOpenModifyBox":false,"isDeleted":false,"isSpam":false,"isEnable":true,"liked":false,"beforeNow":"1月前","author":{"userUid":null,"userId":null,"userRegisterFrom":null,"userEmail":"taipeiliving@gmail.com","userStatus":null,"userProfiles":[],"isAdmin":false,"openId":null,"displayName":"MV","profilePicture":null}},{"msgUid":1484347463928,"userUid":null,"content":"This law us an insult to ordinary foreigners who are effectively being told that we don't deserve the same rights as a rich executive or a basketball player.

One of the details that is particularly objectionable, however, is the minimum salary to be eligible for some of the perks. The problem lies in the relatively low wages here. University faculty, for example, in Taiwan are grossly underpaid, compared to faculty in Hong Kong, Singapore, or Japan. So to those people and their families, the salary cap could be seen this way: &quot;You aren't qualified for these perks because you have been underpaid your whole career.&quot; <br/><br/>For me, the key point for issues like citizenship and a pension is long-term commitment to Taiwan, not money. I suggest the salary cap be eliminated altogether, and permanent foreign residents be allowed to become citizens without being forced to give up their current citizenship. Measuring a person's worth merely by the money they _take_ is surely not the best way to build a sustainable citizenry dedicated to the good of Taiwan.<br/><br/>At the moment, there are many foreigners who love Taiwan. They find their love returned by many of Taiwan's welcoming people, but not by Taiwan's laws and policies. It's good to see that the government is trying to change that--please don't do it half-way.","displayStyle":"normal","status":"ENABLE","isAnonymous":"Y","hasMoreReply":false,"canOpenModifyBox":false,"isDeleted":false,"isSpam":false,"isEnable":true,"liked":false,"beforeNow":"1月前","author":{"userUid":null,"userId":null,"userRegisterFrom":null,"userEmail":"tsellari@gmail.com","userStatus":null,"userProfiles":[],"isAdmin":false,"openId":null,"displayName":"Tom Sellari 施堂模","profilePicture":null}},{"msgUid":1484123294679,"userUid":"486f3340-4639-4f2a-85eb-4f5f802a6a7b","content":"Plum Blossom APRC card holders can be considered as senior professionals which can have Dual Citizenship.

Taiwan disregards foreign tallent already in the country: it is impossible to imagine that foreiners will line up to make a career within a country where those already in the country struggle to make headway in any other career other than education. Taiwan is packed with tallented foreigners who are never given a chance to succeed and spend their entire time here as teachers instead, eventually these give up on any hope of a meaningful career and leave. Taiwan needs to do more to make jobs for those already here available. <br/>The same reason foreigners came here to teach in the first place &mdash;positive word of mouth&mdash; is really the only way to encourage professionals in the long run. <br/><br/>2. Pass regulations that force businesses to provide service in English: no one wants to live in a country where they have to rely on a spouse, girlfriend or friend in order to do the most simple of things like read bills or setup their phone or internet service. <br/>Let's be honest there are very few non-Asian people in the world that can sufficiently speak let alone read Chinese. If Taiwan hopes to encourage large numbers of foreign professionals into the country they are going to have to enourage business (especially large enterprises) to provide their services in English. Doing so could also create a lot of jobs for foreigners in local sevice centers as well as copy writers etc. <br/><br/>3. Offer free or substadized classes in Mandarin: want people to stay? Show them how bad. Every foreigner wants to learn Chinese but either can't afford it or doesn't have the time.
